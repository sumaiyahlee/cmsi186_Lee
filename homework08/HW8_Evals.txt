      CircleSolver and ClockSolver problems

CircleSolver.java class file
   the file must exist and compile
   you can have a constructor if you like but it's not
      needed so this is a "gimme" of one point
   you must read circle parameters from a file
   you must parse and convert the file lines
   you must error check the input
   you must calculate the distance between centers
   you must output the proper relationship between the
      two circles
   you must have a test script file with 20 tests
      one of which tests for invalid file name
   you must have javadoc comments throughout
ClockSolver.java class file
   the file must exist and compile
   you can have a constructor if you like but it's not
      needed so this is a "gimme" of one point
   you must read time string from the command line
   you must parse and convert the time string
   you must error check the input
   you must output proper formatted binary strings
   you must have a test script file with 25 tests
      five of which test invalid input times
   you must have javadoc comments throughout

==========
Nice work on this, although I must admit I'm a little surprised to see two
BinaryClockSolver files, one of which is apparently Sureena's?  It has her
name in the header and except for being named with a "2", it is exactly the
same code...  I trust this was just a model for you to use, since the other
code is different, but it might be a good idea to put in a note of some kind
to let people know so they won't think "plagiarism"...  just sayin'....

The javadocs worked perfectly and there were no errors, as you can see by the
fact that the file "javadocerrorresults.txt" has zero size.

For your CircleSolver, it works, but you didn't follow the specifications,
which clearly state you must read the values from a file.  Instead, you are
taking the values from the command line.  Further, since you are not getting
the file values as two lines, you aren't parsing and converting the lines.
You did a good job of checking the inputs, and displaying a message for the
incorrect input values!  The output formatting looks very nice.

For your BinaryClockSolver, you did a FANTASTIC job of error checking the
command line arguments!  Very impressive.  It seems everything works just as
it's supposed to do.  Great work!

Finally, you were required to have a minimum of seven files in your repo, but
you only had four: your two java files, and your two test scripts.  I don't
count the copy of Sureena's java file in that.

By the way, I copied and modified your mac test scripts to be windows batch
files so I could run them on my windows computer.  I left your files alone so
that you can see the similarities and differences.

Great work!
