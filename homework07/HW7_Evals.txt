==========
AWESOME JOB, Sumaiyah!!  You really nailed this one down!  Your testing is
outstanding, mixing things up with valid/invalid inputs, edge cases, and
all the rest.

I made a copy of your test script file and renamed it to a batch file so I
could run it under Windows.  I left both files so you can see they are the
same.  Windows uses "REM" for comments so I made those changes at the top,
and everything else worked perfectly!

Your code is very clean and consistent, with good variable names and a nice
logical flow.

Excellent and professional-quality work!
