Running BirthdaySolver with hope 


Welcome to Birthday Solver, a program that tests the probability that 2 people share the same birthday out of a group.
USAGE:
   java SkateRamp <numberOfPeople> [numberOfExperiments]
     where: 
       <numberOfPeople> is an integer value that represents the pool of people you'd like to test
       (Integer must be at least 2)
       [numberOfExperiments] is an optional integer value that represents the amount of tests you'd like to perform
       (Default number of experiments is 100,000)
