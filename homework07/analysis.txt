Analysis Report: Sumaiyah Lee

Through my conversations with Professor Johnson, I was able to understand a few things a little bit
better, regarding this assignment. First, regarding the actual probability method, I was able to make
sense of that through my understanding of probability and also understanding that each person represents
a different day. Concerning the experimental probability, Professor Johnson helped me to understand each 
experiment as a different testing room with the same amount of people entered, and we're testing the 
probability that another person in each room has the same birthday. Then, we add the amount of people that
did and divide that number by the number of experiments. Another thing that helped with my understanding,
especially when testing, was that after a certain amount of group of people, around 50, the probability
that another person shared another birthday was almost 100.
