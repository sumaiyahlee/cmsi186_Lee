   View SoccerSimTests.bat to see test parameters used
   Evaluation results are at the bottom of this file
======================================================

The Ball.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes at least four arguments for the x, y, dx, and dy values.  There
must be some sort of "move()" method.  There may be some sort of
"updateSpeed()" method but the computation may be done in move() with
no penalty.  There must be a "toString()" method to display the info
about the ball's location and speed.  There should be an "outOfBounds()"
method, but the computation may be done in the SoccerSim class instead.

The Timer.java or Clock.java class is optional.  If it exists, there is
one point each for the methods listed and any tests included.  Otherwise
this is a freebie, but the functionality of the computations MUST show
up in the SoccerSim.java class file somewhere/somehow.

The SoccerSim.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor
that initializes the simulation.  If the initialization is done in some
other method, that is OK, and credit is given for the constructor.  There
must be some method of validating arguments.  This may be done using the
provided method "validateArgs()" or can be done in the main() method if
that is desired.  There must be some kind of report facility, which can
be either a method "report()" [or similar name], or can be done directly
in the simulation loop in another way.  There needs to be a facility to
detect collisions, which may be either a method like "collisionCheck()"
or can be done directly in the simulation loop.  There must be a main()
method which takes in and handles the argument checking, either directly
or through a method call to something like "validateArgs()".  There are
four points total [1 point for each] awarded for argument checking, which
covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion (no letters)
   - time slice set to default if not on command line
   - time slice validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

Testing includes trials that should show ball[s] come to rest, should
show two balls colliding, and three others to show the balls all go off
the field, all come to a stop, and various ball counts are handled in
the output; the last three are worth a total of three points.

There must be at least two files in the repo: the Ball.java and the
SoccerSim.java files.  If there is a Timer/Clock.java file it is
ignored for credit since it was optional, AS LONG AS THE FUNCTIONALITY
IS AVAILABLE in one of the other two classes.

Detailed omments:
=================
Your Ball class looks good!

There are still a few problems with the SoccerSim class.  I can't get it to
run more than one iteration.  You *DO* check the command line arguments and
output a helpful message to the user.  However, I can't get your sim to use
the default time slice if I don't put one on the command line, and when I
input two balls' worth of arguments I still only get one report before the
program throws a NumberFormatException.

You've done considerable work on this and you have credit for most of it!

Keep up the good work, Sumaiya!!
