
Evaluation for homework 03: Dice Game

Die, DiceSet, and HighRoll Program
   Includes running DieAndDiceSetTestHarness
   Includes running automated HighRoll tests
============================================

The Die.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes one argument for the number of sides for the die object.  There
must be some sort of "roll()" method.  There must be a "getValue()"
method that returns the current value of the die.  There moust be two
"toString()" methods, one static [class] method and one instance method.
The static method must take a Die object as its argument.  There must be
a main method, which has been provided, and it must have at least one
test of the Die class in it, but preferably more.

The DiceSet.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes the number if dice and the number of sides as arguments.  There
must be a "sum()" method that returns the integer sum of all the dice in
the set, as well as a "roll()" method to roll all the dice in the set.
A separate "rollIndividual()" method must exist, taking one argument that
is the index of the Die object to roll.  There must be a "getIndividual()"
method to get the value of a single Die object from the set.  There needs
to be both a class method "toString()" which takes an argument which is
another DiceSet, and an instance method "toString()" which has no argument.
There must be a method "isIdentical()" which takes an argument which is
another DiceSet and returns a boolean based on whether the two sets are
considered identical.  It is your choice as to how "deep" to go when you
make the comparison.  There must be a "main()" method, which is provided
to you, but you must add at least two tests into it.

The HighRoll.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor for
the class that initializes the game.  You have the option of either asking
the user for the number of dice and number of sides at program start up,
or of taking the values from the command line.  In either case, you must
check that the input is appropriate.  Any incorrect inputs must cause the
program to output an error message before ending the program.  There must
be a TUI menu that is displayed in every iteration of the program loop,
and which must have the six selections as stated in class and on the web
page program specification.  There are two points total [1 point for
each] awarded for argument checking, which covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion [no letters]

Testing includes the 17 test sections in the provided test harness called
"DieAndDiceSetTestHarness.java" which will be run to verify the methods
all work properly and will be worth a total of 5 points.  The input to
the TUI menu must consist of the numbers of the selections, except for
the last selection which should be a 'q' for 'quit'.  The batch/shell
script file used for testing will be run on the HighRoll game and there
are 4 points awarded, one for each test.  Output from all testing will
thus be captured to a "testresults.txt" file which will be uploaded to
your repo as part of evaluation for the assignment.

There must be three files in your repo: Die.java, DiceSet.java, and the
HighRoll.java files.


A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

Total 37 out of 37 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score:
Total ?? out of 37 = 94.59% which is an A

Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
The first problem was that you didn't rename your DiceSetEmpty.java file to
be "DiceSet.java"  I did that for you.  It had to happen in three places, the
name of the file, the name of the class inside the file, and the name of the
constructor inside the class.

Next, the DieAndDiceSetTestHarness.java file had a couple of errors that I
fixed because they were left over from when the "setSides()" method was still
being used.  I fixed that as well.

Finally the DiceSet file had "isIdentical()" taking a "DiceSetEmpty" object
which no longer exists, so I fixed that.

By the way, I made copies of your original files and kept them so you can see
just what I did by looking at them side-by-side.

Next, I discovered that in your HighRoll.java file you never changed the name
of the program from MainLoopDemo to HighRoll.  I fixed that too, and now it
all compiles and runs.

However, you still have some work to do in HighRoll.  I've added some comments
to help you along.  You should also add some tests in the "main()" methods in
both the Die.java and DiceSet.java files to check that everything is working
the way it should in the individual files.  Your DiceSet constructor barfs
when the test harness tries to create a set with three six-sided dice.

Keep going, you're almost there!!
